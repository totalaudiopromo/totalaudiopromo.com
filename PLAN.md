# TAP Landing Page Copy Rewrite — Implementation Plan

## Overview
Full copy rewrite of `src/pages/index.tsx`. Preserving all component architecture, styling, images, animations, and links. Only changing text content + restructuring two sections (Problem Agitation and Objection Handling).

---

## Section-by-Section Copy Plan

### 1. META / SEO (lines 23–113)

**Title:** `Total Audio Promo | The Operating System for UK Music PR`

**Meta description:** `Research contacts, draft pitches, track campaigns — one system built specifically for small PR agencies and radio pluggers. By a radio promoter, for radio promoters.`

**Keywords:** Add "radio plugger", "music PR agency", "PR campaign management", "music PR tools UK"

**OG/Twitter titles updated** to match the new headline.

---

### 2. HERO SECTION (lines 181–290)

**Headline:**
> The operating system for running music PR campaigns properly

**Subheadline:**
> Research your contacts. Draft your pitches. Track your campaigns. One system built specifically for small PR agencies and radio pluggers — by someone who's done the job.

**ICP line (bold):**
> For UK PR agencies, radio pluggers, and press agents running 1–10 campaigns at a time.

**Primary CTA:** `Start Free Trial` (keep, single strong CTA)
**Secondary CTA:** Remove "See It In Action" — replace with `See How It Works` linking to #ecosystem

**Trust badges updated to:**
- `Built by a Radio Promoter` (check)
- `Cancel Anytime` (clock)
- `No Credit Card Required` (shield)

**Founder photo area — update caption:**
> `Built from 6+ years running real campaigns. Not a tech company guessing at your workflow.`

**Founder badge copy stays:** "Built by a radio promoter / BBC Radio 1 · 6 Music · Spotify"
**Floating badge:** Change "Data You Own" → `Your Data, Your Contacts`

---

### 3. PROBLEM AGITATION (lines 292–370)
Replacing "Built for experienced operators" section. Same layout (2-column grid, image right). New copy framing.

**New heading:**
> You already know how to do PR. Your tools don't.

**Body copy (replacing the checkbox lists):**

> You're running campaigns across spreadsheets, Gmail, Apple Notes, and maybe a CRM that wasn't built for this.
>
> Contacts live in one place. Pitch drafts in another. Follow-up tracking in your head. Every new campaign starts from scratch because nothing talks to anything else.
>
> You're not missing skill. You're missing a single system that actually fits how PR campaigns work.

**Then a short "This is for you if" list (streamlined):**
- You run a small PR agency or work as a radio plugger (1–5 people)
- You're managing multiple campaigns and losing track of follow-ups
- You're good at what you do — you just need proper infrastructure

**Keep the "NOT for you" list but sharpen it:**
- You're brand new to PR and need someone to tell you what to say
- You want to blast 500 contacts with the same email
- You're looking for a CRM

**Image:** Keep vinyl-throw-action.png

---

### 4. SOLUTION FRAMING HEADER (lines 372–388)

**Badge text:** `Research → Pitch → Track`

**Heading:**
> One system. Three jobs done properly.

**Subheading:**
> TAP handles the three things every PR campaign needs: knowing who to contact, drafting what to say, and tracking what happens next. Each module works alone. Together, they're the full operating system.

---

### 5. INTEL MODULE (lines 392–476)
Reframe as outcome, not tool description.

**Step label:** Keep "1" and "Intel"
**Badge:** Keep "Most Popular" → change to `Start Here`

**Headline:**
> Know exactly who to pitch — and how they want to hear from you

**Description:**
> Stop guessing at email addresses, submission preferences, and whether someone's even still at that station. Intel researches your contacts and gives you verified, enriched data so you pitch the right person, the right way, every time.

**Feature bullets:**
- Verified email addresses — catch bounces before you send
- Submission guidelines pulled automatically (timing, format, preferences)
- Role detection — DJ vs playlist curator vs producer vs journalist
- Confidence scoring so you know which data to trust

**Highlight box:**
> Tested against BBC Radio 1, Spotify editorial, and 200+ UK industry contacts.

**CTA:** `Start Free Trial` — £19/month

---

### 6. PITCHER MODULE (lines 486–566)

**Headline:**
> Draft pitches that sound like you wrote them — because you did

**Description:**
> Pitcher uses your Intel data and your voice to draft context-aware pitches in batches. It respects submission guidelines, references the right details, and gives you a clean draft to review and edit before anything goes out. Not a template. Not a mail merge. A proper starting point.

**Feature bullets:**
- Pulls enriched contact data directly from Intel
- Drafts reference each contact's submission preferences and role
- Batch generation with one-click export — review everything before sending
- Your tone, your style — Pitcher matches how you actually write

**Highlight box:**
> Every pitch is a draft. You review, you edit, you send. Nothing goes out without your sign-off.

**CTA:** `Start Free Trial` — £19/month

---

### 7. TRACKER MODULE (lines 576–657)

**Headline:**
> Never lose track of a campaign again

**Description:**
> Tracker gives you a single view of every campaign — who's been contacted, who's responded, what's been added, and what needs following up. No more scrolling through Gmail trying to remember where things stand. When a campaign ends, Tracker runs an autopsy so you learn from every result.

**Feature bullets:**
- One dashboard for every campaign — contacts, statuses, outcomes
- Follow-up tracking so nothing slips through the cracks
- Campaign autopsy — what worked, what didn't, what to do differently next time
- Benchmark your results against industry averages

**Highlight box:**
> Build institutional memory across campaigns. Stop starting from scratch every time.

**CTA:** `Start Free Trial` — £19/month

---

### 8. FEATURE SHOWCASE — INTEL SPOTLIGHT (lines 662–706)

**Headline:**
> The research that used to take you a full day

**Subheadline:**
> Intel does in minutes what used to take hours of manual Googling, LinkedIn browsing, and guesswork.

**Feature descriptions (rewritten):**
- **Email Validation** — Catches dead addresses before you waste a pitch on them
- **Submission Guidelines** — Pulls timing, format, and preferences so you don't have to dig
- **Role Detection** — DJ, curator, producer, journalist — tailor your approach to their actual job
- **Confidence Scoring** — High, medium, low flags so you know what to trust and what to double-check
- **Web Search** — Finds updated roles, new contact details, and recent moves automatically

**Mockup data:** Keep Jack Saunders example as-is (it's concrete and real).

---

### 9. CASE STUDY BANNER (lines 708–731)

**Keep as-is** — it's real data with a proper disclaimer. Only tweak the disclaimer text:
> Results from real campaigns run manually by the founder between 2020–2025. Not automated outcomes.

---

### 10. EXPERIENCE TIMELINE (line 734)

**Keep as-is** — this is the founder credibility section. It's genuine and well-structured.

---

### 11. SOCIAL PROOF STATS (lines 737–811)

**Header rewrite:**

**Heading:**
> Real numbers from real campaigns

**Subheading:**
> Not projections. Not averages. Actual results from 300+ pitches across 15 campaigns run by the founder between 2020–2025.

**Disclaimer stays** (italic above heading).

**Stat cards — keep the numbers, rewrite labels:**
- 100% → `Enrichment Success Rate` / `Every contact researched came back with usable data.`
- Data You Own → `Your Data, Not Ours` / `Export everything. Nothing locked behind the platform.`
- 14–18% → `Response Rate` / `Industry average for cold outreach is 2–5%.`

---

### 12. PRICING SECTION (lines 813–1268)

**Heading:**
> Start with what you need

**Subheading:**
> Each tool works on its own. Most people start with Intel — it's the foundation everything else builds on.

**Card copy updates:**

**Intel card:**
- Category: `Contact Research`
- Description: `Verified emails, roles, submission preferences, and relationship context. The research layer that makes everything else work.`

**Pitcher card:**
- Category: `Pitch Drafting`
- Description: `Context-aware pitch drafts that match your voice and respect each contact's preferences.`

**Tracker card:**
- Category: `Campaign Tracking`
- Description: `One view of every campaign. Follow-ups, outcomes, and learning — nothing falls through.`

**Bottom text:**
> 14-day free trial. No credit card required. Cancel anytime.

---

### 13. OBJECTION HANDLING (lines 1270–1334)
**Replace the "Professional Standard PR Execution" / guarantee section entirely.**

New section — same position, similar layout but expanded to three cards.

**Heading:**
> This is not another CRM

**Three objection cards in a grid:**

**Card 1: "We already use spreadsheets"**
> So did we. Spreadsheets don't tell you who hasn't been followed up. They don't flag bounced emails. They don't remember what happened last campaign. TAP doesn't replace your judgement — it gives your judgement better information.

**Card 2: "We don't need another tool"**
> You're right — you don't need another tool bolted onto your stack. TAP replaces the five things you're already juggling. One system for research, pitching, and tracking. Not an add-on. A replacement for the mess.

**Card 3: "This looks like a CRM"**
> CRMs are built for sales pipelines. TAP is built for PR campaigns. Different workflow, different data model, different job. If you've tried forcing Hubspot or Pipedrive into PR work, you already know why that doesn't fit.

**Trust badges (below cards, keep existing):**
- 256-bit AES Encryption
- GDPR Compliant
- SOC 2 Infrastructure

---

### 14. NEWSLETTER SECTION (lines 1336–1375)

**Heading stays:** `The Unsigned Advantage`

**Description rewrite:**
> Weekly insights from 6+ years of radio promotion. What's actually working, what's changed, and the stuff nobody tells you about running PR campaigns in the UK.

**Example topics (rewrite):**
- "How I got 6 plays on BBC Radio 1 from one campaign"
- "The submission timing that gets 3x more opens"
- "Why the best pluggers never send the same pitch twice"

---

### 15. FOOTER (lines 1378–1565)

**Description update:**
> The operating system for music PR. Built in Brighton by a radio promoter.

Rest stays the same.
